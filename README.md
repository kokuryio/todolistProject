# Todo - APP for organizing your dailiy tasks

## How to execute
It is possible to store the tasks from the app remotely using a REST service. I used a WildFly server as the backened, however you need to keep in mind to set everything up accordingly
and change the IP - Adress in LoginViwActivity.java (line 28), MainActivity.java (line 23), AsyncCRUDAccessor.java (line 33) and in the 
network_security_config.xml.
